            Explain the term Miniaturization as used in computer generation.
•	Miniaturization refers to the advancement of computers in size portability increase in speed and less power consumption. This can be seen  in the first generation and the 3rd generation computers change in size was an attribute and transformation. The first generation computers were large and heavy they weighed 30tons and consumed  a big space
•	Miniaturization has also been seen by putting or placing many transistor nodes on a smaller integrated circuit  in the 3rd  generation and today
When tracing the evolution of a computer, what advantages come with the fourth generation? 
The fourth generation computers are portable and small sized than the first generation computers that consumed 1500 square feet
The fourth generation computers produce less heat than the first generation computers that produced much heat 
The fourth generation computers are fast in processing data and out putting it 
The fourth generation computers have advanced display mode and devices like the LCD than the CRT that consumed a lot of power
The fourth generation computers have large memory of 1 GB and above that can store large amount of data and information compared to the first generation capacity of 2kb 
The fourth generation computers  dont make a lot of noise while processing data this helps a user to concentrate and work upon tasks  than it was in the first and second generation
